At AppFolio, I design scalable and robust web-based solutions in an Agile team using **Ruby on Rails**, **MySQL**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. I work on [Tenant Screening](https://www.appfolio.com/services/tenant-screening), building and maintaining software to screen tenants quickly and efficiently while maintaining maximum possible data accuracy.

I help support the screening pipeline, from requesting for records and data to reviewing and displaying it on a screening report. This means monitoring and updating these systems to improve accuracy, observability, and throughput while maintaining speed and legal compliance. This includes:
- enhancing our platform and workflow for manual review of criminal and eviction records,
- monitoring and improving the engine we use for automated review, and
- requesting and processing more and varying kinds of records.
