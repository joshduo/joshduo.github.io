As a tutor for the CSE department at UCSD, I assisted over 100 students with comprehension and implementation of data structures and OOP concepts in **Java/Python/C++**, successfully resolving over 90% of my student support tickets. I also analyzed, debugged, and graded studentsâ€™ code, giving detailed feedback on style and correctness to help facilitate their improvement.
