I made this personal website from scratch! I tried to style it to look clean and presentable without feeling tacky and overdone. It's got cool features like CSS animations/transitions and responsive design for tablet and mobile viewing. There's even some JavaScript here and there like on the Resume page. Technologies used include **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
