Hey, I'm Joshua. I'm an alumni of [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cognitive Science. I enrolled **September 2018** and graduated **September 2021**. During my undergraduate career, I worked as a tutor for the CSE department at UCSD, providing instructional assistance for CS courses.

I've always had an interest in technology and want to solve problems and write meaningful code that benefits others. I'm in the process of discovering what field(s) of software engineering I'm interested in working in for my career. To that end, I'd love to find work and gain experience to develop my skills and interests!
