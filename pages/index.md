Hey, I'm Joshua. I'm a software engineer at Appfolio and an alumnus of [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Cognitive Science.  I've been an Appfolian since **November 2021**, developing scalable, robust, and simple web-based solutions for the PropTech space. In college, I worked as a tutor for the CSE department at UCSD, providing instructional assistance for CS courses.

I want to solve problems and write meaningful code that benefits others. I'm always looking to improve my skills and develop my interests!
